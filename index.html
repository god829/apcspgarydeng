      <p id="mj116-history">"Thin son" and "da yuan" are the students who know each other, but they only have the music type 
       that they like together, and do not have the idea of forming a group together. However, after "xiaochun" and "skinny kid", 
       who are <em>both</em> from temple fair and love hip-hop music, met in high school, "young chun" proposed the idea of group to 
       "thin kid", and established naughty boy MJ116 in July <em>2004</em>.</p>
